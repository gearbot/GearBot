# Supporting GearBot

GearBot is free and open source, and will always be like that.

That being said I do host him myself and that has costs, if you want to help with those to make things easier, get some (minor, I don't like paywalls) perks you can check out my Patreon: [https://www.patreon.com/AEnterprise](https://www.patreon.com/AEnterprise).

You can also make a donation on PayPal if you want, you can get the supporter role on discord as well if you put your discord tag in the notes.
