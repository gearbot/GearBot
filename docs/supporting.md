#Supporting GearBot

GearBot is free and open source, and will always be like that.

That being said i do host him myself and that has costs, if you want to help with those to make things easier, get some (minor, i don't like paywalls) perks you can check out my patreon: [https://www.patreon.com/AEnterprise](https://www.patreon.com/AEnterprise)

You can also make a donation on paypal if you want, you can get the same perks as patreon if you leave me your discord tag
