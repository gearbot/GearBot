# Setting a language
If you prefer you can use GearBot in another language than English. Be warned those that not all translations are 100% complete (some are very far from it) and if a string is not available in the language you chose, it will fall back to English.
**NOTE:** This only affects the replies you get from GearBot, not the commands themselves.
You can also help with translating GearBot to your language by joining the Crowdin project [here](https://i18n.gearbot.rocks). More languages can also be added if there is interest and people willing to translate to the language.

To change the language GearBot replies in:
```
!configure language <lang_code>
```
