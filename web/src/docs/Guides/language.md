# Setting a language
If you prefer you can use GearBot in another language then english. Be warned those that not all translations are 100% complete (some are very far from it) and if a string is not available in the language you chose, it will fall back to english.
**NOTE:** this only affects the replies you get from GearBot, not the commands themselves
You can also help with translating GearBot to your language by joining the crowdin project [here](https://crowdin.com/project/gearbot). More languages can also be added if there is interest and people willing to translate to the language

To change the language GearBot replies in:
```
!configure language <lang_code>
```
